# Face Anonymizer Computer Vision Project

## Overview
This project aims to provide a solution for anonymizing faces in images using computer vision techniques. The anonymization process involves detecting and replacing facial features with blurred or pixelated regions, ensuring privacy protection while maintaining the overall context of the image.

## Features
- **Face Detection**: Utilizes state-of-the-art face detection algorithms to accurately locate faces within an image.
- **Face Recognition**: Identifies facial features to apply anonymization techniques specifically to faces.
- **Anonymization Techniques**: Anonymization is done through blurring the region in which the face is deteted.
